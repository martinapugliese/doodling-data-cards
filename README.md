# Doodling Data - cards material

Repo supporting the work to create "data cards" as part of the Doodling Data [project](https://doodlingdata.substack.com/). Mostly contains scrappy Jupyter notebooks I've used to pull and analyse data.

The categorisation here into topics is of course arbitrary, and topics can overlap: it is just for ease of search.
