# Doodling Data Cards

Repo supporting the Doodling Data Cards project ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/doodledatcard/)) as well as all the work that goes into organising and analysing datasets for data stories of various sorts, normally presented on my [blog](https://martinapugliese.github.io/).

The code here is mostly present in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

The categorisation here into topics is of course arbitrary, and topics can overlap: it is just for ease of search.
