# Data on the editions of the FIFA world cups

Data manually compiled from a combination of Wikipedia and FIFA website.

The accompanying NOTES.md file contains detailed explanations over quirks of each edition.

## Notes on the data

* If the number of qualified and playing teams don't agree is because some teams withdrew, see Wikipedia for details - we reported the number of playing teams in num_teams
* Num_stadiums and num_cities indicate the number of stadiums and cities matches were played in
