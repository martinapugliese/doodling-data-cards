# Travel


## Instagram

Contains data taken from Instagram about places/cities etc.

### Cities hashtags

Number of posts per city, with city name in different languages, to proxy how visited they are (not just tourism clearly, will be also work travels) - used EN, IT, FR, DE, ES, PT as languages and some important in Europe (to avoid missing data, cities from other languages are not there); data taken 6/11/2018

Also, sometimes there is hashtag like #london:<uk-flag>, these have also taken, see the file. Sure there will be other possibilities but weren't considered. ALso note hashtags are not case-sensitive. Also note that posts can be tagged with multiple hashtags so there is the possibility that counts are duplicated

All data is manually taken, was too much of a pain to do via APIs & stuff for such a small thing. Obvs we know that there'll be loads of spurious posts not depicting the city and tagged with hashtag, that's why this is rough.
