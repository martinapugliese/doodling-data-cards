# Plants

backbone-current has been downloaded for plant taxonomy (but there's all kingdoms I think) from https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c

I've searched for plant taxonomy while I was trying to do a viz about genera per continent and realising there's too many genera for a radar chart. My radar chart work is on Observable. So I needed to coarse the data, hence needed a taxonomy. Scraping wikipedia proved to not quickly yield the info as it's in the infobox but that is a "template" type object which cannot be quickly parsed for info ( I mean could be done but I wanted to get data quick if I could). 

Genera list is from the sheet I have created for myself here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oXMgjjZ_2OaHkoxEPT-2UuP1chxF5JbR1eESm6xWYk0/edit#gid=1339674825

I've deliberated about using the species name from the svalbard set instead of the genus, and search for it in this dataset here, but if feels like given the spelling, the shortenings (e.g. L.), it'd be a less clean/more error-prone procedure.
